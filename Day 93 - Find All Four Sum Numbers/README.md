Find All Four Sum Numbers
---------------------------
Given an array of integers and another number. Find all the unique quadruple from the given array that sums up to the given number.

TestCase 1:

Input:
N = 5, K = 3
A[] = {0,0,2,1,1}
Output: 0 0 1 2 $
Explanation: Sum of 0, 0, 1, 2 is equal
to K.

TestCase 2:

Input:
N = 7, K = 23
A[] = {10,2,3,4,5,7,8}
Output: 2 3 8 10 $2 4 7 10 $3 5 7 8 $
Explanation: Sum of 2, 3, 8, 10 = 23,
sum of 2, 4, 7, 10 = 23 and sum of 3,
5, 7, 8 = 23.
