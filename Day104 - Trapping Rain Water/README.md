#Trapping Rain Water
-----------------------
Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 

TestCase 1:

Input:
N = 6
arr[] = {3,0,0,2,0,4}
Output:
10

TestCase 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {7,4,0,9}
Output:
10
Explanation:
Water trapped by above 
block of height 4 is 3 units and above 
block of height 0 is 7 units. So, the 
total unit of water trapped is 10 units.

TestCase 3:

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {6,9,9}
Output:
0
Explanation:
No water will be trapped.
