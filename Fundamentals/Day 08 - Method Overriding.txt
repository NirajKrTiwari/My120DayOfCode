Method Overriding in Java
----------------------------
If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.

In other words, If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class, it is known as method overriding.

Usage of Java Method Overriding
1. Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.
2. Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

Rules for Java Method Overriding
1. The method must have the same name as in the parent class
2. The method must have the same parameter as in the parent class.
3. There must be an IS-A relationship (inheritance).

Example:

//Java Program to demonstrate the real scenario of Java Method Overriding  
//where three classes are overriding the method of a parent class.  
//Creating a parent class.  
class Bank{  
int getRateOfInterest(){return 0;}  
}  
//Creating child classes.  
class SBI extends Bank{  
int getRateOfInterest(){return 8;}  
}  
  
class ICICI extends Bank{  
int getRateOfInterest(){return 7;}  
}  
class AXIS extends Bank{  
int getRateOfInterest(){return 9;}  
}  
//Test class to create objects and call the methods  
class Test2{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
SBI s=new SBI();  
ICICI i=new ICICI();  
AXIS a=new AXIS();  
System.out.println("SBI Rate of Interest: "+s.getRateOfInterest());  
System.out.println("ICICI Rate of Interest: "+i.getRateOfInterest());  
System.out.println("AXIS Rate of Interest: "+a.getRateOfInterest());  
}  
}  

Output:
SBI Rate of Interest: 8
ICICI Rate of Interest: 7
AXIS Rate of Interest: 9
