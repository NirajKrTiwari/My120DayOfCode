Threads
--------
There are two ways to create a thread:

1. By extending Thread class
2. By implementing Runnable interface.

Thread class
-------------
Thread class provide constructors and methods to create and perform operations on a thread.Thread class extends Object class and implements Runnable interface.

Commonly used Constructors of Thread class:
--------------------------------------------

1. Thread()
2. Thread(String name)
3. Thread(Runnable r)
4. Thread(Runnable r,String name)

Commonly used methods of Thread class:
---------------------------------------

01. public void run(): is used to perform action for a thread.
02. public void start(): starts the execution of the thread.JVM calls the run() method on the thread.
03. public void sleep(long miliseconds): Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease execution) for the specified number of milliseconds.
04. public void join(): waits for a thread to die.
05. public void join(long miliseconds): waits for a thread to die for the specified miliseconds.
06. public int getPriority(): returns the priority of the thread.
07. public int setPriority(int priority): changes the priority of the thread.
08. public String getName(): returns the name of the thread.
09. public void setName(String name): changes the name of the thread.
10. public Thread currentThread(): returns the reference of currently executing thread.
11. public int getId(): returns the id of the thread.
12. public Thread.State getState(): returns the state of the thread.
13. public boolean isAlive(): tests if the thread is alive.
14. public void yield(): causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.
15. public void suspend(): is used to suspend the thread(depricated).
16. public void resume(): is used to resume the suspended thread(depricated).
17. public void stop(): is used to stop the thread(depricated).
18. public boolean isDaemon(): tests if the thread is a daemon thread.
19. public void setDaemon(boolean b): marks the thread as daemon or user thread.
20. public void interrupt(): interrupts the thread.
21. public boolean isInterrupted(): tests if the thread has been interrupted.
22. public static boolean interrupted(): tests if the current thread has been interrupted.

Runnable interface:
--------------------
The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. Runnable interface have only one method named run().

public void run(): is used to perform action for a thread.

Starting a thread:
------------------
The start() method of Thread class is used to start a newly created thread. It performs the following tasks:

1. A new thread starts(with new callstack).
2. The thread moves from New state to the Runnable state.
3. When the thread gets a chance to execute, its target run() method will run.


1) Java Thread Example by extending Thread class
-------------------------------------------------
class Multi extends Thread{  
public void run(){  
System.out.println("thread is running...");  
}  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Multi t1=new Multi();  
t1.start();  
 }  
}  
Output:

thread is running...


2) Java Thread Example by implementing Runnable interface
-----------------------------------------------------------
class Multi3 implements Runnable{  
public void run(){  
System.out.println("thread is running...");  
}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Multi3 m1=new Multi3();  
Thread t1 =new Thread(m1);   // Using the constructor Thread(Runnable r)  
t1.start();  
 }  
}  
Output:

thread is running...

3) Using the Thread Class: Thread(String Name)
------------------------------------------------
public class MyThread1  
{  
// Main method  
public static void main(String argvs[])  
{  
// creating an object of the Thread class using the constructor Thread(String name)   
Thread t= new Thread("My first thread");  
  
// the start() method moves the thread to the active state  
t.start();  
// getting the thread name by invoking the getName() method  
String str = t.getName();  
System.out.println(str);  
}  
}  
Output:

My first thread

4) Using the Thread Class: Thread(Runnable r, String name)
------------------------------------------------------------
public class MyThread2 implements Runnable  
{    
public void run()  
{    
System.out.println("Now the thread is running ...");    
}    
    
// main method  
public static void main(String argvs[])  
{   
// creating an object of the class MyThread2  
Runnable r1 = new MyThread2();   
  
// creating an object of the class Thread using Thread(Runnable r, String name)  
Thread th1 = new Thread(r1, "My new thread");    
  
// the start() method moves the thread to the active state  
th1.start();   
  
// getting the thread name by invoking the getName() method  
String str = th1.getName();  
System.out.println(str);  
}    
}    
Output:

My new thread
Now the thread is running ...
