Segregate even and odd nodes in a Link List
--------------------------------------------

Testcase 1:

Input: 
N = 7
Link List:
17 -> 15 -> 8 -> 9 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> NULL

Output: 8 2 4 6 17 15 9

Explaination: 8,2,4,6 are the even numbers 
so they appear first and 17,15,9 are odd 
numbers that appear later.

Testcase 2:

Input:
N = 4
Link List:
1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7

Output: 1 3 5 7

Explaination: There is no even number. 
So ne need for modification.
