#Next Permutation
--------------------------
TestCase 1:

Input: N = 6
arr = {1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4}
Output: {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6}
Explaination: The next permutation of the 
given array is {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6}.

TestCase 2:

Input: N = 3
arr = {3, 2, 1}
Output: {1, 2, 3}
Explaination: As arr[] is the last 
permutation. So, the next permutation 
is the lowest one.
