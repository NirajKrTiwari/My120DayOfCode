Median in a row-wise sorted Matrix
-----------------------------------
Given a row wise sorted matrix of size R*C where R and C are always odd, find the median of the matrix.

TestCase 1:

Input:
Input:
R = 3, C = 3
M = [[1, 3, 5], 
     [2, 6, 9], 
     [3, 6, 9]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Sorting matrix elements gives 
us {1,2,3,3,5,6,6,9,9}. Hence, 5 is median. 

TestCase 2:

Input:
R = 3, C = 1
M = [[1], [2], [3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Sorting matrix elements gives 
us {1,2,3}. Hence, 2 is median.
