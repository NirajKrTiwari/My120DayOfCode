Find Missing And Repeating
---------------------------
Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

TestCase 1:

Input:
N = 2
Arr[] = {2, 2}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
smallest positive missing number is 1.

TestCase 2:

Input:
N = 3
Arr[] = {1, 3, 3}
Output: 3 2
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and 
smallest positive missing number is 2.
