Preorder to BST
----------------
Given an array arr[] of N nodes representing preorder traversal of some BST. You have to build the exact BST from it's given preorder traversal. 
In Pre-Order traversal, the root node is visited before the left child and right child nodes.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[]  = {40,30,35,80,100}
Output: 35 30 100 80 40
Explanation: PreOrder: 40 30 35 80 100
Therefore, the BST will be:
              40
           /      \
         30       80
           \        \   
           35      100
Hence, the postOrder traversal will
be: 35 30 100 80 40
