Find Pair Given Difference
---------------------------
Given an array Arr[] of size L and a number N, you need to write a program to find if there exists a pair of elements in the array whose difference is N.

TestCase 1:

Input:
L = 6, N = 78
arr[] = {5, 20, 3, 2, 5, 80}
Output: 1
Explanation: (2, 80) have difference of 78.

TestCase 2:

Input:
L = 5, N = 45
arr[] = {90, 70, 20, 80, 50}
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no pair with difference of 45.
