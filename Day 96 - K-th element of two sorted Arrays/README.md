-----------------------------------
Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of size N and M respectively and an element K. The task is to find the element that would be at the kâ€™th position of the final sorted array.

TestCase 1:

Input:
arr1[] = {2, 3, 6, 7, 9}
arr2[] = {1, 4, 8, 10}
k = 5
Output:
6
Explanation:
The final sorted array would be -
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
The 5th element of this array is 6.

TestCase 2:

Input:
arr1[] = {100, 112, 256, 349, 770}
arr2[] = {72, 86, 113, 119, 265, 445, 892}
k = 7
Output:
256
Explanation:
Final sorted array is - 72, 86, 100, 112,
113, 119, 256, 265, 349, 445, 770, 892
