Count triplets with sum smaller than X
---------------------------------------
Given an array arr[] of distinct integers of size N and a value sum, the task is to find the count of triplets (i, j, k), having (i<j<k) with the sum of (arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k]) smaller than the given value sum.

TestCase 1:

Input: N = 4, sum = 2
arr[] = {-2, 0, 1, 3}
Output:  2
Explanation: Below are triplets with 
sum less than 2 (-2, 0, 1) and (-2, 0, 3). 

TestCase 2:

Input: N = 5, sum = 12
arr[] = {5, 1, 3, 4, 7}
Output: 4
Explanation: Below are triplets with 
sum less than 12 (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5), 
(1, 3, 7) and (1, 4, 5).
